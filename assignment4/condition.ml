(** A fiber-level condition variable.

    Implementation: a plain FIFO queue of triggers.  {!wait} relies on
    the unicore invariant that "no context switch happens unless we
    perform an effect (await / yield / a channel op)" — this is what
    makes the enqueue-then-unlock sequence atomic, without needing any
    extra state-machine gymnastics.

    ones — unused here because [Condition] does not participate in
    [Select], but kept for symmetry and future extension). *)
